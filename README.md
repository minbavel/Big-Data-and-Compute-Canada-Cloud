# Big-Data-and-Compute-Canada-Cloud
Big Data is changing the way Research is conducted, especially in fields where computational methods were not traditionally used. So, processing of huge amount of data can be next to impossible when doing it in a personal system. To compute these data, Traditional HPC clusters in compute Canada cloud can be used where the user has control over the software stack and can configure it with typical Big Data Stacks. The question we begin to explore is how we can increase the efficiency and get desired output by reducing the processing time using HPCâ€™s where our input will be a Big Data stack. We used Compute Canada Cloud becuase they give free resource to their cloud for reseachers.

This is a Simple R Code showing the difference it makes in processing data Serially and Parallaly.
